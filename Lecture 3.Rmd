Plan for today:

1. Test assignment.
2. The **tidyverse** framework (https://www.tidyverse.org/).
3. Reading in data with **readr**.
4. Transforming data with **dplyr**.
5. Statistical assignment 1: questions.
6. Homework for next week.

Importing data: read ch.11 from R for Data Science (Data import): https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html and ch.2 from my website (Read data): http://abessudnov.net/dataanalysis3/readdata.html.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Data <- read_tsv("/users/catherinegalley/Documents/DataThree/data/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_wx/xwavedat.tab")
```

This is a cross-wave data file with stable characteristics of individuals. See the codebook at https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/dataset-documentation/wave/xwave/datafile/xwavedat.

See the dplyr cheetsheet: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf

Exercises.

1. Select the variables for: sex (derived), date of bith (derived), ethnic group (racel_dv). Also keep the cross-wave identifier (pidp) and the sample origin variable (memorig). 
```{r}
colnames(Data)
Data1 <- Data %>% select(pidp, sex_dv, doby_dv, racel_dv, memorig)
``` 
2. Filter the data to keep (in new data frames):
        a) men only.
        b) people born before 1950 and after 1975.
        c) men of Pakistani origin born in 1958 or 1982. 
```{r}
Data_men <- Data1 %>% filter(sex_dv == 1)
Data_dob <- Data1 %>% filter(doby_dv > 0 & (doby_dv < 1950 | doby_dv > 1975))
Data_Pak <- Data1 %>% filter(sex_dv ==1 & racel_dv == 10 & (doby_dv == 1958 | doby_dv == 1982))
```
Discuss: logical operators.

3. Recode birth year into cohorts (a new variable): the G.I. Generation (born before 1924), Silent Generation (1925-42), Baby Boomers (1943-65), Generation X (1966-1980), Millenials (1981-99), Generation Z (2000-). (The years are approximate.)
```{r}


Data1 <- Data1 %>% 
  mutate(generation = case_when(
  between(doby_dv, 0,1923) ~ "G.I. Generation",
  between(doby_dv, 1924,1942) ~ "Silent Generation",
  between(doby_dv, 1943,1965) ~ "Baby Boomers",
  between(doby_dv, 1966,1980) ~ "Generation X",
  between(doby_dv, 1981,1999) ~ "Millenials",
  doby_dv >= 2000 ~ "Generation Z"
  ))


Data1 %>% 
  pull(generation) %>% 
  class()

Data1 %>%
  pull(generation) %>%
  table()
  
```
4. Recode ethnicity into the following groups: white British, Other White, Indian, Pakistani, other. (This classification doesn't make much sense, but we're doing this as an exercise).
```{r}
Data1 %>% 
  mutate(Ethnicity = case_when(
                 racel_dv == 1 ~ "White British",
                 between(racel_dv,2,4) ~ "Other White",
                 racel_dv == 9 ~ "Indian",
                 racel_dv == 10 ~ "Pakistani",
                 between(racel_dv, 5, 8) | racel_dv >= 11 ~ "Other"
                 ))
                  
                   
                                   
```
Discuss: numeric and character vectors (strings), factors. Missing values in R.

5. Count the number of people belonging to different ethnic groups (and produce percentages). 
```{r}
Data1 %>% 
  count(racel_dv) %>%
  mutate(perc = n / sum(n) *100)
```
6. Summarise the proportion of white British by generation.
```{r}
Data1 %>% 
  filter(racel_dv != -99) %>%
  mutate(WhiteBritish = ifelse(racel_dv == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(generation) %>%
  summarise(
    PropWhiteBritish = mean(WhiteBritish, na.rm = T) *100
  )
```
7. Summarise the proportion of women by birth year.
```{r}
table(Data1$sex_dv )
Data1 %>% 
  filter(sex_dv > 0) %>%
  mutate(Women = ifelse(sex_dv == 2,1,0))
  group_by(doby_dv) %>%
  summarise(PropBirthYear = mean(Women) * 100)

```
